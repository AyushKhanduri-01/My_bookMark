# My_bookMark
This project is based on Native Android Application Development. In this project, I have created an application that is used to store all our web bookmarks in a single place.
In this application, we can add any number of websites as bookmarks, and with a single click, we can reach that site. This saves our time in finding important saved links and makes things more manageable.
To add a new bookmark, it takes two inputs: the title of the bookmark and the URL.
